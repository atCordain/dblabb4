# PantShirtMatch

A simple console application exploring Entity Framework and CosmosDB (using emulator).

As a user you can:
- Define a look (Combination of Pants and Shirt)
- Name your look (this gets saved to the database)
- Rank different looks based on comparison with other looks in a category (Think Look-Thunderdome, two looks enter, one look exits)
- See the current highscore per category

As an administrator you can:
(The administrator password is "password")
- Add/Remove/Edit and Delete items of clothing from the database (Pants and Shirts)

Happy matching!
